# 💻 Tribute Page | freeCodeCamp

## 📖 Description

This is my solution for the *Tribute Page* challenge from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), using HTML and CSS. After sending my final solution to the site, I decided to improve it, changing the colors of the icons, removing the IDs to clean up the code a little and improve the text content.

For this project, I wanted to make a tribute for this person, who was a Brazilian politician, medic, professor, military, translator and many other things. His name is Enéas Carneiro, a very intelligent and peculiar individual.

Since English is not my mother language, you may find misspellings, or weird sentences that may not fit the context. Said that, it was very fun writing and researching for this project, since it was a very good English exercise for me. I usually use dictionaries and spell checkers to improve my writing instead of just throwing everything on a random translator, and, although it may take way more time to finish it, it's worth the effort.

Concluding, if you agree or disagree with this person, that's a natural thing, it is fine. It is not my intention to attack any political view or offend anyone. My final objective here was just to find an interesting figure of my country to use as the subject for the project. Thank you for reading!
